        <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
          <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM).</li>

      <div className="mb-4">
        <h2 className="font-semibold text-md">Algorithm Selection:</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
          <li>
            Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was chosen for its robustness
            in handling complex datasets and its ability to find optimal
            decision boundaries. SVM performs well in high-dimensional spaces
            and is effective in cases where the data may not be linearly
            separable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Random Forest, on the other hand, was selected for its ensemble
            learning approach, which combines multiple decision trees to improve
            prediction accuracy. It is capable of handling large datasets with
            high dimensionality and is less prone to overfitting compared to
            individual decision trees.
          </li>
